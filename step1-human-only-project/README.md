# CodeLab: Creating a Fitness App Using Project Copilot and GitHub Copilot
## Step 1: Initial Version of the Project Created by Humans Only
This project is planned to be completed in one sprint. For this sprint, 2 epics and 4 user stories were created, with 2 user stories assigned to each epic. Here are the epics and their associated stories:

_Note: Due to a time budget of 10 hours for the entire project, instead of writing the epics and user stories properly with the correct format, we have only written them as a feature request._
