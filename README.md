# CodeLab: Creating a Fitness App Using Project Copilot
## Summary
This CodeLab is a brief tutorial on how to utilize Project Copilot and GitHub Copilot in a small software development project.

The CodeLab provides an initial version of the project as a starting point. This version was exclusively created by a human, with the constraint of completing the project epics, user stories, sub-tasks, code, and peer reviews in a maximum of 10 hours.
The goal of the CodeLab is to gradually recreate the same project with the assistance of Project Copilot and GitHub Copilot in less than 1 hour to finally compare both projects, and get metrics about the planning and implementation.

The project's objective is to develop a compact client-side fitness application using HTML and JavaScript. This application should be capable of interfacing with the Google Fit REST API and computing daily calorie consumption based on the number of steps taken. Additionally, it should calculate a health score derived from these calories and "heart points."
