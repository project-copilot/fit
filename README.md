# CodeLab: Creating a Fitness App Using Project Copilot
## Summary
This CodeLab is a brief tutorial on how to utilize Project Copilot in a small demo software development project.
The CodeLab provides an initial version of the project as a starting point. This version was exclusively created by a human, with the constraint of completing the project epics, user stories, sub-tasks, code, and peer reviews in a maximum of 10 hours.
The goal of the CodeLab is to gradually recreate the same project with the assistance of Project Copilot in less than 1 hour and compare both projects, including planning and implementation.

The subject of the project is to create a small HTML and JavaScript client-side fitness app capable of consuming the Google Fit REST API and calculating the calories consumed during the latest running session. This calculation is based on sensor measurements collected during the session, such as steps, heart rate, and respiration rate. Additionally, based on these same measurements and after a short period of recovery, the app calculates a score to indicate the training status, assessing how quickly and effectively the user returns to their normal state.
